                <h4>Walking Tours</h4>
                <p>
                    Free Walking tours are a great way to see a new city. So much so that I recommend taking one as 
                    soon as you arrive in a new city. Not only does it allow you to see most of the more important 
                    sights in the city, but it may even clue you onto new sights to see which you may not have 
                    previously known about. It also is a good chance to talk to your guide about anything you might 
                    not be sure about such as good places to eat etc. Finally, walking tours provide a great 
                    opportunity to meet other like-minded travellers. As a solo traveller, sometimes you may feel 
                    the urge to sightsee with other people. For me, this is the best way to meet them, especially as 
                    these tours almost always end at lunch time. Asking someone to join you (or being asked to join 
                    them) for lunch is a relatively painless way to transition from random stranger to one off 
                    sight-seeing buddy. My general rule for these tours in regards to payment is thus: 5 pounds/euros 
                    per person for an adequate tour, 10 for a great one, 15 for an absolutely phenomenal one. The vast 
                    majority of the time I usually give away 5 pounds/euro. Just remember to have your cash ready in 
                    advance! Also worth noting, you can usually just rock up to one of these last minute, but many 
                    prefer that you "sign up" in advance. This can easily be done the night before, or earlier if 
                    you're sufficiently organised.

                <h4>Sim Card</h4>
                <p>
                    Buying a pre-paid sim card is highly recommended. As of 2016, you will only need one for the whole 
                    of Western Europe! And most of the East too! In your case, you will most likely be meeting us in 
                    Malta, so long as you have the trip planned from the airport to your accommodation, we can help you 
                    take care of the rest! You can use the airport wi-fi to help facilitate that. If you do ever get 
                    caught in need of internet because of sim card issues, remember that in Europe almost every cafe will 
                    offer wi-fi. Starbucks can be especially useful in these situations, assuming the city you're in is 
                    big enough to have one.

                <h4>Accommodation</h4>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the question of accommodation you have several options available:<br>
                    <h6>Airbnb</h6><br>Probably has the best range of prices and quality for what you're looking for. Oftentimes, you 
                    will be able to find an airbnb with better prices and comfort than hotels or hostels. It will however 
                    require much more planning. To start with, to get a good airbnb, it helps to book at least a month, if 
                    not 3 months in advance, otherwise most of the rooms you might want will already be booked. Also worth 
                    mentioning is that organising a handover of keys can take a little more effort this way, which can be 
                    annoying when carrying a large bag.<br><br>
                    <h6>Hostels</h6><br>As you've made clear, this is not your preferred option. They are however, a great backup, and 
                    almost all hostels nowadays offer private rooms. This will set you back a little more than a decent 
                    airbnb, but less than a hotel. The other benefit to hostels, other than being able to book them last 
                    minute, is that the staff there are very used to giving travellers with your budget advice and tips. 
                    Finally, a hostel has the advantage of being able to look after your bags even if you arrive before your 
                    check in time.<br><br>
                    <h6>Hotels</h6><br>The last real option. Has many of the benefits of hostels, (such as sometimes being available 
                    last minute and will hold your bags before check in) but usually offers a higher level of comfort for a 
                    higher price. Could be worth considering if you ever need to put your feet up for a day.<br><br>
                    <h6>Couchsurfing</h6><br>Probably not worth considering for you considering you're not into the hostel vibe, but couchsurfing is 
                    also an option. It would require a significantly greater amount of effort in advance to organise, but 
                    it's free and is a great way to meet people (if you have the energy). If you were to ever consider this, 
                    let me know and I'll help you set it up.

                <h4>Transport</h4>
                <p>
                    So, how should you get around?<br>
                    <h6>Planes</h6><br>Expensive, not real good for the environment and kind of uncomfortable. Necessary for long 
                    distances but not really recommended for anything else. It must be said however, that they're a lot 
                    cheaper over in Europe than what you'd expect.<br><br>
                    <h6>Trains</h6><br>Fast, moderately comfy and a tad pricey. Great if your time constraints are tighter than your 
                    budget. Trains out of Budapest in particular are a little cheaper, so definitely worth checking out.<br><br> 
                    <h6>Buses</h6><br>Slower, less comfortable but definitely cheaper than trains. Probably your best option for 
                    shorter trips for which trains might not be worth it.
                </p>

                <h4>One Day Trip Logisitics</h4>
                <p>
                    On your way, you may be tempted to visit a moderately out of the way destination. In that case there are 
                    several ways to go about it. A simple day trip to and from you accommodation is easy enough, but a stop 
                    planned halfway from one stop too another can also work. Most stations will have lockers for leaving bags 
                    at, and some even take card nowadays. Failing that, you can actually ask any hotels in the area if they'd be 
                    willing to look after your bags for a few hours, they may just say yes!
