                <h4>Walking Tours</h4>
                <p>
                    Free Walking tours are a great way to see a new city. So much so that I recommend taking one as 
                    soon as you arrive in a new city. Not only does it allow you to see most of the more important 
                    sights in the city, but it may even clue you onto new sights to see which you may not have 
                    previously known about. It also is a good chance to talk to your guide about anything you might 
                    not be sure about such as good places to eat etc. Finally, walking tours provide a great 
                    opportunity to meet other like-minded travellers. As a solo traveller, sometimes you may feel 
                    the urge to sightsee with other people. For me, this is the best way to meet them, especially as 
                    these tours almost always end at lunch time. Asking someone to join you (or being asked to join 
                    them) for lunch is a relatively painless way to transition from random stranger to one off 
                    sight-seeing buddy. My general rule for these tours in regards to payment is thus: 5 pounds/euros 
                    per person for an adequate tour, 10 for a great one, 15 for an absolutely phenomenal one. The vast 
                    majority of the time I usually give away 5 pounds/euro. Just remember to have your cash ready in 
                    advance!
