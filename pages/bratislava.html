                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    Bratislava, capital of Slovakia. Formerly one half of Czechoslovakia, which, unsurprisingly, was formed of 
                    Czechia and Slovakia. Bratislava has had a tumultuous history, having been ruled by many many different 
                    empires and regimes. More recently, it it's own communist country (as Czechoslovakia), becoming a 
                    democracy throught the Velvet Revolution. It remained as part of Czechoslovakia until it became their it's 
                    own independant country in the early 90's, making it a relatively young nation. Given it's location, many 
                    people assume it to be underdeveloped in comparison to many of the "Western countries", however that is 
                    incredibily misleading, as Slovakia boasts relatively high incomes, has great records in regards to 
                    liberties and freedoms and has actually held on to many of the "good" parts of it's communist regime ie: 
                    free education and universal healthcare.

                <h4>Language</h4>
                <p>
                    Slovak is the primary language of Slovakia (surprise) and has much in common with Czech, as well as many 
                    other slavic languages such as Polish.<br>
                    A few common phrases to get you going include:<br><br>
                    Hello: Dobrý deň. Pronounced do-bree-djen. Literally the words for good and day if I'm not mistaken. Ahoj 
                    (pronounced ahoy). Can be used in place of goodbye as well and is absolutely delightful to say.<br>
                    Please: Prosím (pro-sim). Sometimes sounds like it's pronounced with and -s sound, sometimes with a -z. 
                    Maybe it's both?<br>
                    Thank you: Ďakujem. Pronounced dja-koo-yem.<br>
                    Goodbye: Dovidenia. Pronounced do-vee-dje-nia. If it sounds familiar, it's because almost every country in 
                    a straight line from Slovakia to Russia say goodbye in a similar way.<br>
                    Cheers: Na Zdravie. I always screw this one up, it's pronunced somewhere between naz-dra-vee-ay and 
                    naz-drav-yeah. It sounds like the Russian word for cheers but gods don't ever say that to anyone from 
                    Slovakia, Russia or even Czechia or Poland. There is a subtle difference between the more commonly known 
                    Russian pronuciation and the Slovak one, but the difference between say, Slovak and Polish for example, is 
                    pratically non-existant.

                <h4>Sights To See</h4>
                <p>
                    Bratislava, unlike it's neighbouring capitals of Vienna, Prague and Budapest, was never meant to be a capital 
                    city. When Slovakia became it's own independant country they simply had to just pick a capital from their 
                    existing cities. As such, it is a much more subdued place to visit, which does make it ideal for a small 
                    trip.<br><br>
                    Here's a short list of obvious sights to see.<br><br>
                    <h6>Bratislava Castle</h6><br>Very often in Europe you will visit a "castle" expecting some grand, stone built 
                    structure with steeples and high walls and such. And more than half the time your expectations will be betrayed. 
                    Bratislava is one of what I would call "modern castles", functional above everything else. It sits atop the hill 
                    in Bratislava and offers great views.<br><br>
                    <h6>The Blue Church</h6><br>There's a few different religious buildings to see in Bratislava, but for me the 
                    stand out is definitely the Blue Church. One of the rarer Art Noveau churches, it will definitely stand out from 
                    the many other's you'll see on your trip.<br><br>
                    <h6>Hviezdoslav Square</h6><br>The "main drag" of Bratislava. The national theatre sits at one end and is quite 
                    impressive. Has a bunch of really cool ice-cream places which will put together an ice-cream for you in a more 
                    performative manner. There's several there and sadly I don't remember which one we visited, but if you take a 
                    walking tour here, ask your guide which one's best and they'll point you in the right direction.<br><br>
                    <h6>Primate's Palace</h6><br>Primaciálny Palác in Slovak, has been repurposed into the mayor's office.<br><br>
                    <h6>Presidential Palace</h6><br>Known as Grasalkovičov Palác or Grassalkovich Palace, it's an impressive looking 
                    building built along some nice gardens.<br><br>
                    <h6>Old Town Hall</h6><br>Stará radnica. Stará means old, and if you pay attention, you'll see that word a lot. 
                    Lives in the main square of town.<br><br>
                    <h6>Eurovea Waterfront</h6><br>It may seem odd to visit what is essentially the plaza to a supermarket, but it's 
                    location and design make it worth a visit if you have time. There's also a few market stalls here usually.<br><br>
                    <h6>UFO Bridge</h6><br>One of the bridges crossing the Danube which sports an intersting looking tower above it. 
                    Apparently there's a restaurant in the tower which serves traditional Slovak cuisine, but it seemed like it might 
                    be expensive so Megan and I chose not to check it out.<br><br>
                    <h6>Statues</h6><br>Most European cities will usually have a bunch of random statues all over the place, but the 
                    ones in Bratislava are significantly more cheerful than most. See how many you can find!<br><br>
                    <h6>Napolean's Balls</h6><br>After Napolean pretty much waltzed through Bratislava, the city decided they would 
                    reimburse anyone who's house had taken damage from the cannon fire which had just occurred, provided that they 
                    could prove their house had taken damage. Some of the more industrious citizens of Bratislava decided to cash in 
                    on this and planted some very conspicuously placed cannonballs into the outer walls of their homes as "proof" that 
                    their house had sustained damage. Not long after this, Napolean's winning streak came to an end, and the locals joke 
                    that although Napolean beat the city of Bratislava, he eventually lost because he "left his balls" (cannonballs that 
                    is) behind in Bratislava. As you walk through the streets, you will notice that some of these cannonballs remain 
                    embedded into the facades of buildings to this day.<br>

                <h4>Food And Drink</h4>
                <p>
                    Many of the foods which are common in Slovakia are perhaps more famous in other countries nearby, such as Goulash, 
                    Pierogi and Schnitzel. Nevertheless, I will add in a few different ones which I experienced or heard of while 
                    there.<br><br>
                    <h6>Fried Cheese</h6><br>You may see this on a sign as Vyprážaný Syr. A quick, easy and cheap street food option.<br><br>
                    <h6>Zemiakové Placky</h6><br>It's pretty much a fancy hash brown. Delicious.<br><br>
                    <h6>Slovenske Palacinky</h6><br>Slovak style crepes. No explanation needed.<br><br>
                    <h6>Drinks</h6><br>From Slovakia eastward, you'll find spirits to be the unofficial kings of liquor. So it makes 
                    sense that Slovakia is home to a few liqueurs of it's own.<br><br>
                    <h6>Spirits</h6><br>Borovička is the most traditional Slovak liqueur and is made from Juniper berries. Also from 
                    Slovakia is Tatratea, which honestly just sounds like deathly alcoholic tea from the Tatra mountains. And then 
                    there's of course Slivovica. Considered a kind of "pálinka" by the countries to the west and a kind of "rakia" by 
                    the countries to the east, it's probably the most quintessential beverage of what we would conider "Eastern" Europe.<br><br>

                <h4>In The Area</h4>
                <p>
                    Devín Castle (Devínsky Hrad) lies a short distance from Bratislava. This is one short trip which is actually worth it 
                    and very doable. Especially as this castle sits in between Bratislava and Vienna. It may take a bit of effort, but you 
                    could visit it either on your way to or from Bratislava. A castle in the more traditional sense, it definitely feels 
                    more historic than almost anything you'll find in Bratislava.
