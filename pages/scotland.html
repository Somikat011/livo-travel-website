                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    Scotland will always have a special place in my heart. I truly loved living in Edinburgh and its three 
                    dimensional maze of streets, it's handful of modern buildings juxtaposed amongst a historic cityscape of 
                    castles and cobblestones. The northern most country in the United Kingdom, Scotland is and feels 
                    infinitely more liberal than any of the other countries, with the Scottish National party usually taking 
                    the lion's share of Scottish votes. Friendly people, beautiful landscapes and a sexy ass accent (in my 
                    opinion), what's not to like?

                <p>
                    It's fairly unlikely you will head far north enough to hear any Scottish Gaelic (other than hearing 
                    someone shout "Slàinte!" with a drink in hand) but there are a ton of little words and sayings that make 
                    Scotland feel distinct. See how many you can find while you're there. You could pull them out next time 
                    you get forced to do a Scottish accent during improv! Afterall, you cannae visit Scotland without picking 
                    up a wee bit of the lingo. Quick note though, slàinte is pronounced slan-je in Scotland, which is different 
                    to the Irish pronunciation. They'll know what you mean if you get wrong though.

                <h4>Sights To See</h4>
                <p>
                    What to see in Scotland? There's sooooo much. So much so, that to see all the good bits, you'd need to come 
                    back again with a car and a lot more time. Here's a few of the more notable things to see and do!<br>
                    <h6>Edinburgh</h6><br><br><br>
                    <h6>Glasgow</h6><br>Glasgow is a city you live in rather than visit. Kinda like Melbourne. In fact, given 
                    it's proximity to Edinburgh, it's very common for residents of Edinburgh to go to Glasgow for things like 
                    live music shows and such, sometimes taking a train back to Edinburgh in the same night. Glaswegians have a 
                    reputation for being rough and hard to understand (accent wise), but personally I think that the reality is 
                    slowly drifting away from said reputation.<br><br>
                    <h6>Stirling</h6><br>A short train ride from both Glasgow and Edinburgh lies Stirling. A smaller, quieter 
                    town (especially compared to Glasgow and Edinburgh), Stirling gains most of it's fame for the Wallace 
                    Monument, made to commemorate William Wallace aka Braveheart. The monument itself is an old tower which now 
                    serves as both monument and museum.<br><br>
                    <h6>The Highlands</h6><br>One of the most spectacular road trips possible in Europe and indeed the world, 
                    would be a trip around and through the Scottish Highlands. The weather may not always be nice, and if it is 
                    then you'll almost certainly get swarmed by insects, but even with that, the Highlands from start to finish 
                    are a breathtaking experience in natural beauty. Best explored with a car and about 7 to 10 days minimum, 
                    the Highlands can take a considerable amount of time out of any journey. If you were to try and see just a 
                    part of it, then from Edinburgh you'd either head to the Isle of Sky for a day or two, or to Inverness, 
                    from where it is possible to visit Loch Ness.<br><br>

            <div class="text-box">
                <h4>Food And Drink</h4>
                <p>
                    As far as good goes, you're probably already aware of all the famous Scottish foods, so this is going to 
                    focus more and fun little things instead!<br><br>
                    <h6>Haggis</h6><br>There's a few different ways to try haggis. You could find a store which makes it 
                    specially, it's also offered in a lot of pub breakfasts as part of a "big breakfast" along with some black 
                    pudding. You could get it as a topping in a sandwich or hamburger. You could even buy some from the frozen 
                    food section of the supermarket!<br><br>
                    <h6>Fish and Chips</h6><br>Classic all along the United Kingdom. Quick thing to note. Firstly, you're most 
                    likely to be eating cod rather than what you're used to in Aus. Unless you're up towards the highlands, then 
                    you might end up with some of the seafood the Scottish coast is famous for. You'll also probably be offered 
                    "brown sauce" as a topping. It tastes fine, sometimes like vinegar (I swear it's a little different depending 
                    on where in the UK you are). What's in the brown sauce? No one knows.<br><br>
                    <h6>Oink</h6><br>An Edinburgh institution, Oink serves pork rolls. That's it. There's a few around, including 
                    one right off the royal mile.<br><br>
                    <h6>Söderberg</h6><br>If you decide to take a stroll through "the Meadows", a park in the heart of the student 
                    area of Edinburgh, you could pop into Söderberg for a coffee and snack. This is where Megan worked while we 
                    lived there. It's a tad pricy, the coffee is ok, but the cinnamon rolls? Delicious. Unhealthy but delicious.<br><br>
                    <h6>Thai Food</h6><br>Sick of eating traditional foods? You could head over to where I used to work, the 
                    immensely popular Ting Thai for a quick snack. With competitive prices, a unique modern Thai fusion menu and 
                    a location right by the university, during peak hours the line goes out the door. That being said, if you I 
                    was ordering Thai food in Edinburgh I'd go to Soi 38. The owner used to be a backup dancer for S Club 7 back 
                    in the day and is an all round cool guy. I worked with him for a while and I highly doubt he remembers me, but 
                    who knows, if you see him, say hi from Jai!<br><br>
                    <h6>Drinks</h6><br>The scottish love a good drink and Edinburgh has a great range of venues from filthy 
                    student pubs to classy cocktail bars. Megan's pick would definitely be the Salt Horse, a small craft beer pub. 
                    If thinking about typical Scottish drinks, as much as beer is probably the most common go to, Scotch is 
                    definitely what should come to the front of your mind. Checking out a distillery is a classic thing to do while 
                    visiting. If we're talking soft drink, try an Irn Bru. They tried to change the recipe for it a little while 
                    ago and there was such a backlash from the greater community that they had to change it back.<br><br>

                <h4>In The Area</h4>
                <p>
                    Well, Scotland is a whole country, but if you had to say what's "in the area", then I'd say the Lakes 
                    District in England. Right below Hadrian's Wall, the Lakes District is a beautiful little spot ideal for 
                    lazy hikes, gazing out over bodies of water or even camping.
