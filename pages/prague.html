                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    Prague, capial of Czechia. Along with Budapest is perhaps one of Europe's most up-and-coming backpacking 
                    destinations. Historic, atmospheric and in an ongoing love affair with food and drink (especially beer), 
                    it's no wonder Prague has seen a massive influx of tourists in the last few years. Capital of the 
                    Bohemian empire, which fell after the conclusion of WW I, Prague became the capital of Czechoslovakia. 
                    Prague then became the epicenter of what became known as the "Velvet Revolution", which celebrates one of 
                    the most peaceful transitions of power, from communism to modern democracy. From there, Czechoslovakia 
                    split into what we now recognise as Czechia and Slovakia.

                <h4>Language</h4>
                <p>
                    The language of Czechia is ,unsurprisingly, Czech. It has such a high crossover with Slovak, the language of 
                    it's neighbour Slovakia, to the point where speakers of either can freely converse with each other with 
                    little to no effort.<br>
                    A few common phrases to get you going include:<br><br>
                    Hello: Dobrý den (do-bree-den). The formal way to say hello. The cool informal way is to say "ahoj" (ahoy).<br>
                    Please: Prosím. Pronounced pro-seem.<br>
                    Thank you: Děkuji. Pronounced dje-koo-yee. This is the correct and formal pronunciation. You could also say 
                    Děkuju (dje-koo-yoo) for a more informal version. Spice that up by adding moc (mots) at the end. Děkuju moc 
                    (dje-koo-yoo-mots) means thank you very much.<br>
                    Goodbye: Na shledanou (sometimes spelt Nashledanou) is the formal way to say goodbye and is a headache to 
                    pronounce. My best efforts to try goes like na-s-hle-da-no. The s and h combo aren't pronounced the way 
                    English speakers would expect, so it's almost easier to pretend it's two words spelt nas and hledanou. It's 
                    much easier to say either ahoj (ahoy) or the univerisally accepted čau (chow). That last one is essentially 
                    the Italian greeting ciao and is used in almost all of Europe as a way to say goodbye.<br>
                    Cheers: Na zdraví (naz-dra-vee). A very important word in a country which loves beer as much as the Czechs 
                    do. It's pronounced slightly differently from the Slovaks and means something along the lines of "to health".

                <h4>Sights To See</h4>
                <p>
                    Here's some things to checkout while visiting Prague!<br>
                    <h6>Prague Castle</h6><br>Top of the list is going to be Prague Castle, mostly because there's actually quite 
                    a bit to see here. Not only can you simply visit the castle, but you could also watch the changing of the guard 
                    if you arrive on the hour during daylight. It should be noted, that the changing of the guard at midday is a 
                    bit more involved then the others, so that's probably the one you'd like to see. Inside the castle gates 
                    is St. Vitus Cathedral, the largest cathedral in Czechia. Also within the castle grounds is "Zlatá Ulička" 
                    (golden lane), a pituresque lane once home to the city's goldsmiths. The grounds and some of the attractions are 
                    free to access, but other parts, like the castle, require a fee. You can line up on the day to enter the castle, 
                    but you can also book tickets in advance and save yourself the hassle.<br><br>
                    <h6>Charles Bridge</h6><br>If you were to mentally envision a beautiful, old, European bridge, it would probably 
                    look like this one. Definitely worth taking a stroll down. If you happen to remember much of the Spiderman movie 
                    where Tom Holland goes to Europe, you may remember this bridge as being the location of an important scene!<br><br>
                    <h6>The Jewish Quarter</h6><br>Like with many other historic European cities, Prague contains an old Jewish 
                    quarter. The one in Prague is somewhat unique in that the residents had to be very economical with their use of 
                    space compared to others.<br><br>
                    <h6>Churches And Cathedrals</h6><br>St.Vitus Cathedral is probably the most famous religious building in Prague, 
                    gut the Church of Our Lady of Victories is also worth mentioning as it is home to a famous statue called the 
                    "Infant Jesus of Prague".<br><br>
                    <h6>Old Town Square</h6><br>Another staple of just about every historic European city is the old town square. It 
                    is predicatably where you will find the old town hall, with it's very famous astrological clock. Wonderfully 
                    complex and suprisingly old, this clock will put on a show on the hour every hour, so time your visit right and 
                    you'll get to see the kind of clock chiming event you would expect to see in an old timey cartoon.<br><br>
                    <h6>Malá Strana</h6><br>Most of Prague's attractions and amenities sit on the eastern side of the river, but if 
                    you're heading to the castle, you're probably going to pass through Malá Strana (roughly translates to the 
                    little/lesser/small quarter). While there, you might as well take a look around at what, architecturally speaking, 
                    is a more modern part of the city.<br><br>
                    <h6>Statues</h6><br>Look around and try and find as many zany statues as you can. There's one particular statue of 
                    Sigmund Freud which can be a bit of a surprise to find.<br><br>
                    That is just some of things you can see, but what's there to do?<br><br>
                    <h6>Parks</h6><br>Tired of the hustle and bustle of the city? How does a picnic lunch in the park sound? Prague 
                    boasts quite a few nice and quiet parks to visit with a snack, the most famous of which, (Petřínské Sady / Petrin 
                    Gardens and Letenská Pláň / Letna Park), lie on the western side of the park, not far from the palace. Both offer 
                    relatively good views of the city. If I remember correctly, we had a chill out at Petrin Gardens which was quite 
                    nice.<br><br>
                    <h6>Museums</h6><br>Musuems are especially good places to visit if you happen to be interested in the history which 
                    has shaped the city you've found yourself in (as a rule, national musuems are best for this), but specific to Prague 
                    are museums related to the communist era. Each different communist dicatorship was different, from Albania, to the 
                    USSR, to Czechoslovakia to Yugoslavia, so it's no wonder that their recollections of their time under communism 
                    differ greatly. If you were ever curious as to what it was like in Czechoslovakia, then the communism museum is 
                    where you should head.<br><br>
                    <h6>Galleries</h6><br>Galleries are ubiquitous amongst the capitals of Europe, but some of the ones in Prague make 
                    very good use of what would have been abandoned space.<br><br>
                    <h6>Nightlife</h6><br>As you'd imagine for a country with such a emphasis on drinking culture, Prague is home to many 
                    bars and clubs. Looking up one or two famous ones is always an option, or to make life simpler, you could always join 
                    one of what I can guess would be many bar hopping tours available in the city.<br><br>
                    <h6>Defenestration</h6><br>Errr, don't actually do it, but be sure to impress the guide of your walking tour by 
                    knowing what it is in advance. The Bohemians loved a bit of defenestration, it was kind of their thing.<br>

                <h4>Food And Drink</h4>
                <p>
                    Much like with it's neighbours, Czechia shares a lot of it's common cuisine with it's neighbours. Pierogi, goulash, 
                    fried cheeses and schnitzels are common fare in Czechia as well as in the countries surrounding it. You're quite 
                    likely to notice a more "snacky" approach to food, which shouldn't be surprising in a country with such a love affair 
                    with beer. Which is an important thing to remember. Czechia is very much a country of beer. It's actually the country 
                    with the greatest per capita consumption of beer in the world! Anyways, here are some standouts for things to eat 
                    while in Prague.<br><br>
                    <h6>Trdelník</h6><br>You may notice this pipe shaped dessert in the neighbouring lands surrounding Czechia, but Prague 
                    in particular is the place where you will see it absolutely everywhere. Interestingly, it's hard to say if it's roots 
                    are actually based in Czechia, but one thing is for sure, Prague has adopted it as it's trademark dessert. It's 
                    commonly found in small stores all around the city, and can be eaten by itself or with a variety of fillings.<br><br>
                    <h6>Obložené chlebíčky</h6><br>Pretty much just an open sandwich. Many European nations have a similar dish, but I'd 
                    argue Czechia's version is usually the prettiest. I once heard that the Czech version has it's roots in communist 
                    history, where shortages of goods led to making the most with what you had at hand. I don't know if that's entirely 
                    true, but it makes sense.<br><br>
                    <h6>Drinks</h6><br>As mentioned already, beer is an important part of Czech culture. Most other spirits you can 
                    find in Czechia tend to have stronger roots in other countries, so don't expect much coverage for them here. So what 
                    should you expect instead?<br><br>
                    <h6>Pilsner</h6><br>Of all the beers you will encounter in Czechia, pilsners hold a special place. Actually named for 
                    the Czech city they were orginally brewed in (Plzeň), modern pilsners are all essentially copies of the original: 
                    Pilsner Urquell. Pilsner Urquell was the first pale lager and is arguably the beer to drink while in Czechia. That's 
                    not to say that all their beers are Pilsners or that you shouldn't try any other beers, but it would be fair to say that 
                    none other have the same historic importance all clout as Pilsner Urquell.<br><br>

                <h4>In The Area</h4>
                <p>
                    If for some reason you get really bored with Prague, you could try visiting the Adršpach-Teplice Rocks. As well as being 
                    a beautiful national park, it is also the location where a few famous scenes were shot in the Narnia movies. A warning 
                    to drone users, it's also a large breeding area for falcons who are likely to grab said drones right out of the air. It 
                    takes several hours to get there from Prague, so I doubt it will make your list, but who knows? This information might 
                    come in handy anyways.
