                <p>
                    I mean, there's probably not much to say here, especially as you'll have a local helping you out, not to mention you 
                    could just as easily ask Jonny for anything you might need, so I'll keep it short, both here and in all sections 
                    subsequent sections. In fact, rather go through the history or anything like that, here's just a bunch of random facts 
                    you may or may not know. There are no wild snakes in Ireland. There's a story as to why, ask someone to see if they 
                    know. Ireland was neutral during WW II. Makes a lot more sense if you think about the historical implications of an 
                    old Irish government having to actively side with the English. You can, with great amounts of ease, work as Aussie in 
                    Ireland. I looked into it, you don't even need to fly back and do anything in Australia. You can straight up just land 
                    in Ireland and decide you don't want to leave and get a job all without leaving Ireland itself.

                <p>
                    Once again, you could probably ask Jonny about this and get much better answers. Gaelic isn't exactly a widely used 
                    language, so there's probably not much use learning any other than for enjoyment. If you are interested, I'm pretty 
                    sure Duolingo has a course on it. What you can do while your there? Ask a police officer if they have any "craic". 
                    That's always fun. Or salute to a toast of drinks with "sl√°inte" (pronounced a couple different ways, I remember 
                    saying something along the lines of slawn-che). Other than that, I don't have much for you.

                <h4>Sights To See</h4>
                <p>
                    What to do while you're in Ireland?<br>
                    <h6>Dublin</h6><br>Presumably you'll fly into Dublin and will want to spend a day or so there. Which should be easy 
                    enough. There's plenty to do in Dublin, such as visiting the Guiness factory, which also happens to be the tallest 
                    building in Dublin. You could visit Trinity College, location of the Book of Kells as well as the location of arguably 
                    my favourite annual feminist event. Or maybe you just want to chill out, you could grab yourself a cup of soup and hang 
                    out near the statue of Oscar Wilde. If it's nightlife you're after, head to the area around Temple Bar! Also, apparently 
                    there's a difference in accent between people from differing sides of the river, if you can figure out what the 
                    difference actually is, then you're doing better than me!<br><br>
                    <h6>Cliffs of Moher</h6><br>Probably one of the most breathtaking sights to see in arguably all of Europe (and that's 
                    saying something) are the cliffs of Moher. Absolutely stunning and mildly nerve wracking if you're partner likes getting 
                    as close to the unprotected edge as possible. A few hours out of Dublin, it is a trek, but 100% worth it. You'd likely 
                    spend a few hours there, as they stretch out for a little bit and you can take a fairly gentle stroll from one side to 
                    the other.<br><br>
                    <h6>Ring of Kerry</h6><br>Also breathtaking, but much lesser known (and a little harder to visit) than the cliffs of 
                    Moher. Would require access to a vehicle and is more of a drive then a one stop visit. A little bit like driving along the 
                    Great Ocean Road.<br><br>
                    <h6>Small Towns</h6><br>Galway, Cork, Limerick. Small towns are aplenty around Ireland. Drive throught the green (gods I've 
                    never seen so much green in my life) rolling hills and find explore a quaint little town. Meander through the streets! 
                    Hang out in the local pub. Enjoy the slow life!<br><br>

                <h4>Food And Drink</h4>
                <p>
                    No doubt you will be familiar with most of the fare you can find in Ireland, so I'll keep this short.<br><br>
                    <h6>Restaurants</h6><br>Assuming you did want to try something local, there are a variety of restaurants which will 
                    sell exactly what you're looking for. I went to one not far from Trinity College, no idea if it still exists though. I 
                    imagine most pubs will also have what you're after.<br><br>
                    <h6>Drinks</h6><br>I mean, you know where this is going.<br><br>
                    <h6>Alcohol</h6><br>The obvious one here is guiness. There's a hole factory here for it. Outside of that, Whiskey and 
                    Gin are worth a look at. Ireland was going through the same global love affair with gin as everywhere else 5 or so years 
                    ago, and the number of distilleries around are testament to that.<br>
                    The one thing I will say, for the love of all that's good, don't buy your drinks in or anywhere near the famous Temple 
                    Bar, unless you want to pay through the nose for your drinks.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h4>In The Area</h4>
                <p>
                    Given where you'll be going for a surf, you may even find yourself with the opportunity to see Northern Ireland. Maybe it 
                    might entail a simple trip to the Giant's Causeway, a meander through Derry learning about the troubles or a brief glimpse 
                    of Belfast. I would definitely recommend all the above. The Giant's Causeway is a great visit if you're more into amazing 
                    natural geological features, whereas if history and politics are more your thing, Derry, and even Belfast, are must sees.
