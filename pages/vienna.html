                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    Vienna (Wien). Capital of Austria (Österreich) and was the seat of power for the Hapsburg empire, one of the many "Holy 
                    Roman Empires" to exist. Also one of the last proper empires to exist before the modern age. Also the location of one 
                    of the most important UN offices in the world. Austria is now a completely neutral country which is a direct result 
                    from their part in WWII as well as for being the birthplace of Hitler. Nowadays it's a very comfortable trendy city, 
                    as well as being one of Jai's top cities to live in outside of Melbourne. Vienna is one of four capitals situated 
                    on the Danube river, three of which you will most likely be visiting (along with Budapest and Bratislava).

                <h4>Language</h4>
                <p>
                    Austrian speak German (Deutsch), although you'll be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't speak perfect English.<br>
                    You probably know most of these already, but hey, a few common phrases to get you going include:<br><br>
                    Hello: Hallo. For real. The most common way is just an off brand hello. I've been told by German speakers that 
                    I have a great German pronuciation of it if you ever want to hear one. Then there's of course Guten Tag, for more 
                    formal situations. You could say Wie Gehts (pronounced "vee-gets") which is more of a "how's it going" hello/how are 
                    you hybrid. My personal favourite is "Was geht ab" (vas-get-up), which is essentially "what's up?".<br>
                    Goodbye: Auf Wiedersehen. Very famous way to say goodbye. More commonly used is Tschüss (sounds kinda like the word "juice"). 
                    You can also say Ciao. Literally anywhere in Europe you can say that one. Almost every European country understands and uses 
                    Ciao liberally, including the other non-english speaking countries you'll visit.<br>
                    Thank you: Danke. Or Dankeshoon (dan-ke-shon), which is literrally the word for thanks and the word for pretty squashed together.<br>
                    Please: Bitte. Same rules as above, you cans say "pretty please" by saying Bitteshoon (bit-te-shon) instead.<br>
                    Excuse Me: Entschuldigung (En-shul-dee-goong). I only used that one twice, both times after accidentally walking into 
                    someone, but there you go, you know it now too.<br>
                    Exactly: Genau (gen-ow). Deutsch speakers love saying this word. If you ever need to agree with someone, say genau with 
                    plenty of enthusiasm. Seriously, you'll hear it all the time while there.
                    Cheers: Prost. You could say this Europe over and just about everyone will know you mean cheers. Some people, but not all, 
                    will say "Fernprost" (literrally the words far and cheers) if you're too far away for physical glass clinking.<br><br>
                    The Austrian pronunciation of many words is a little different from the German one. If you happen to know the German 
                    pronunciation well enough, see if you can spot the differences!

                <h4>Sights To See</h4>
                <p>
                    What to see in Vienna? Here's a quick list of things Megan and I checked out!<br>
                    <h6>Schönbrunn Palace</h6><br>The summer palace of the Hapsburgs. Apart from there being some cool old buildings to visit/climb 
                    up onto, there's also a zoo and a massive span of beautiful gardens. You could easily lose an entire day in here. For most of 
                    the locals, it's really just the world's fanciest jogging track. Real pretty though, highly recommend.<br><br>
                    <h6>Heldenplatz And Hofbur Palace</h6><br>Hofburg palace was the home to the emperors of the Hapsburg empire and remains a 
                    famous historical site to date. The plaza it's located in, Heldenplatz, is worth a visit on it's own.<br><br>
                    <h6>Maria-Theresien-Platz</h6><br>Named after the famed Maria Theresa, one of Austria's shrewdist leaders and one 
                    of the most famous female rulers in history, her statue can be found in the middle. Around the plaza are several musuems, 
                    if you were looking to see a general history musuem, it's probably here.<br><br>
                    <h6>Churches And Cathedrals</h6><br>Vienna homes several impressive religious buildings of many different styles. Of 
                    particular note are St Stephen's Cathedral (having already seen is Basilica in Budapest, I'm sure you're pumped to see 
                    his Cathedral), Peter's Catholic Church and St Charles' Church (Karlskirche).<br><br>
                    <h6>Vienna City Hall (Rathaus)</h6><br>Germanic city halls (Rathauses) are very impressive looking and Vienna's is 
                    particularly spectacular. There's a good chance that if you decide to take a free walking tour it will start from here.<br><br>
                    <h6>Mozarthaus</h6><br>Visit the home of Mozart! Because, you know, you can do that. It's a museum now if you have a 
                    musical history itch that needs scratching.<br><br>
                    <h6>Mozarthaus</h6><br>Visit the home of Mozart! Because, you know, you can do that. It's a museum now if you have a 
                    musical history itch that needs scratching.<br><br>
                    <h6>Prater</h6><br>Here's one that you probably won't see on a walking tour. When Megan and I visited Vienna we stayed 
                    with some awesome Couchsurfers who took us for a walk in this area. Imagine a showground/carnival type thing. Good for 
                    a chill afternoon stroll!<br><br>
                    <h6>Hundertwasserhaus</h6><br>Check out these super quirky and colourful houses! Designed by a famous Austrian artist, 
                    they make for a good photo opportunity! If you like that, there's a museum related to this particular artist somewhere 
                    in the city.<br><br>
                    Other than sights to see, are there also things to do?<br><br>
                    <h6>Opera</h6><br>Opera was very important to Austrian history and culture and the big musical names they brought into 
                    the world are testamount to that. If you're interested, remember, book in advance!<br><br>
                    <h6>Spanish Riding School</h6><br>These horseback performances became incredibily famous during the rule of the Hapsburgs. 
                    If seeing a random horseback show interests you, you can see one here, and in a very historic place to boot! As with most 
                    activites, this needs to be booked well in advance.<br>

                <h4>Food And Drink</h4>
                <p>
                    Austria has many foods that it is famous for which you are probably already aware of, strudel, schnitzel. In fact, wiener 
                    comes from Vienna. As you may remember, Vienna in Deutsch is spelt Wien. Wien, wiener. Expect to pay a little bit extra for 
                    food in Vienna compared to most of the other places you visit<br><br>
                    Here's a short list of some things you'd expect and maybe a few you wouldn't!<br>
                    <h6>Wiener Schnitzel</h6><br>The classic Vienna style schnitzel. While in Aus we tend to have chicken schnitzel, in the 
                    Germanic countries pork is the usual go to. In the case of the Wiener Schnitzel, you'll be eating veal.<br><br>
                    <h6>Wiener Wurstel</h6><br>The wiener you were probably more likely to be expecting. Classic street food, usually can be 
                    bought for a cheaper price than something from a restaurant.<br><br>
                    <h6>Tafelspitz</h6><br>This dish is definitely more on the homier end. Essentially boiled meat and veg. The kind of food 
                    you'd expect to be served by someone's grandma.<br><br>
                    <h6>Vegan Burgers</h6><br>Just before Megan and I had arrived in Austria, a new burger chain had taken Vienna by storm. 
                    Swing Kitchen serves vegan burgers at moderately affordable prices, with some tasty lemonade options on the side. Although 
                    this isn't what you'd call traditional Austrian fare, Swing Kitchen has definitely become a staple for the locals.<br><br>
                    <h6>Apfelstrudel</h6><br>The classic dessert made with apples and almost certainly contains raisins. You can find them 
                    without raisins if that's an issue for you, but they're harder to find.<br><br>
                    <h6>Sachertorte</h6><br>Arguably the dessert the people of Vienna are most proud of. Invented in a local hotel, there's a 
                    good chance you'll hear of it's origin story on your walking tour.<br><br>
                    <h6>Drinks</h6><br>As you'd expect of a country bordering both Germany and Czechia, Austrians love a good beer. Given your 
                    fortuitous timing, you'll even be able to partake of some seasonal drinks!<br><br>
                    <h6>Glühwein</h6><br>As Austria will be heading into winter, it may be the perfect time to drink some Glühwein! One of my 
                    favourite drinks, especially on a cold day, it's synonymous with Germanic christmas. If you're lucky in fact, some of the 
                    Christmas market stalls may even be setting up (very early) when you're there. The christmas markets of countries like 
                    Austria, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in particular (although just about every European country has them) are such 
                    an amazing spectacle, if you ever get the chance to experience them you absolutely should.<br><br>
                    <h6>Radler</h6><br>A mixed drink containing beer, it's usually more of a summer drink, but hey, you do you.<br><br>
                    <h6>Sturm</h6><br>This one is seasonal and can only be served in the last quarter of the year. Hurray for you! Essentially 
                    a young wine made from, if I remember correctly, either leftover or lesser quality grapes. I quite liked it and it's very 
                    unique. There exists a similar non-alcoholic beverage called Most if you're interested.<br><br>
                    <h6>Coffee</h6><br>Coffee has a special place in the heart of Vienna. When they were sieged by the Ottomans, they got through 
                    by the skin of their teeth (and with a lot of help from the Polish). After fending off the attackers, they found a large 
                    supply of coffee beans, which at the time, were only really found in the muslim empires to the east and in North Africa. 
                    This birthed the Austrian Coffee Houses, which hold great historic and cultural significance in Vienna in particular. If 
                    you choose to visit one, you can try and order a Wiener Melange, their original version of a latte.<br><br>
                    <h6>Tap Water</h6><br>Only one place in the world has managed, in my opinion, to produce tastier tap water than what is 
                    available in Melbourne. And that is Vienna. How do they do it? Easy, they pipe it in directly from the Alps. Viennese tap 
                    water is some of the freshest, if not the freshest, tap water you can find in the world. Just be sure you get it from the 
                    middle of the city. The infrastructure which pipes the water in only serves the Vienna which existed at the time. As the 
                    city has grown since then, the outer suburbs don't have access to the alpine waters.

                <h4>In The Area</h4>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of just out of the way hikes which give you great views of the city if that interests you. Otherwise, a trip 
                    across the Danube to Bratislava could very well be an option. In that case, I would definitely try and dedicate a whole day to 
                    that particular trip.
