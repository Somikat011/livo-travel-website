        <h2>Budapest</h2>

        <div class="travel-advice">

                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    Budapest, capital of Hungary. It's actually pronounced "Buda-pesh", which you may remember from the Black 
                    Widow movie. Budapest is made up of two distinct areas, "Buda" and "Pesh" (spelt Pest). Hence the name. Buda (the 
                    fancy part) and Pest (where you will undoubtedly spend most of your time) are separated by the Danube river, 
                    spanning from Germany to Ukraine. You could theoretically take a boat from here to Vienna and Bratislava. Because 
                    of its location and history, there is a definite blend of several different styles here, as well as some things 
                    which are either local to or popularized in Hungary. Like the Art Noveau tiling and architecture for example. 
                    Budapest also suffered heavily during World War II, which has inadvertently created one of the cities most famous 
                    tourist activities.

                <h4>Language</h4>
                <p>
                    Hungarian, or Magyar Nyelv (pronounced something like Majar Nyev), is an incredibly unique language which 
                    shares it's roots with Finnish and Estonian. Looking at a map, this may seem confusing, but it is notheless the 
                    truth.<br>
                    A few common phrases to get you going include:<br>
                    Hello: Szia. Pronounced like see-ya. Easy to remember as the pronunciation sounds exactly like the opposite of 
                    what it actually means.<br>
                    Thank you: 
                    Please: 
                    Cheers:
                </p>

                <h4>Sights To See</h4>
                <p>
                    Many of the following you will definitely see on a walking tour of the city, but I'll just go through some of the 
                    more famous ones that we witnessed as well as some lesser known ideas.<br>
                    Let's start with the easy ones. The follwing buildings are worth a quick visit or a simple viewing:<br>
                    Buda Castle. Most of what you'll see is actually a reconstruction, as much of the original was destroyed. The walk 
                    up to the castle is steep but pretty. If you're worried about being too tired, there is a Funicular you can take.<br>
                    Fisherman's Bastion. Located near the castle, this very cool looking spot offers great views/photos of Pest.<br>
                    The Chain Bridge. Known locally as Széchenyi. If you are visiting Buda you will most likely do so via this bridge. 
                    It conveniently leads directly to the base of the castle. Although you will almost certainly cross it during the day, 
                    it is worth seeing again at dusk/night as the bridge and castle both will be lit up.<br>
                    Parliament House. Easily visible from Buda, this building is easily one of the most impressive in Budapest.<br>
                    St Stephen's Basilica. There are several religious buildings in Budapest and the most impressive is easily St 
                    Stephen's Basilica. Fun fact, you normally need to remove any head coverings to enter, but if you're Jai, they may 
                    make their own assumption and confuse you for a muslim, and somehow convince themselves that your bandana is of 
                    religious significance and can therefore be worn inside.<br>
                    Heroes' Square. A square full of statues of significance, some being angels, others being "founders" of Hungary.<br>
                    Central Market Hall. Like most European capitals, Budapest has a historic market are. A great spot to just walk 
                    around or grab some fresh fruit for lunch.<br>
                    The House of Terror. An absolute must see for anyone interested in history. The building itself was used for 
                    nefarious means, it now stands as a museum to educate others about genocide and oppression. A bit depressing, but a 
                    must see.<br>
                    The Danube. Walking along the Danube is always a good idea for any city it passes through. Of particular note in 
                    Budapest is Margaret island, an island featuring parks and a "dancing fountain".<br>
                    The Jewish Quarter. Most old European cities have a Jewish quarter. In cities such as Barcelona, this section of the 
                    city is incredibly historic. In the case of Budapest, it is where most of the cool pubs and bars are located.<br>
                    There are many monuments remembering those who lost their lives during WWII as well as to the Soviets. Some of which 
                    feel a little on the nose, as you may remember, Hungary was one of the original Axis powers. There are definitely 
                    many sincere works however, statues of suitcases, plaques and such. The most famous of these are almost certainly 
                    the shoes on the Danube, a line of metal shoes representing the Jewish lives lost to the Nazis.<br>
                    Budapest also has great street art. Just by walking through the streets you will find a variety of interesting and 
                    inventive pieces.<br>
                    Speaking of things you can take in as you walk, Budapest is an absolute mismatch of Art Noveau, Gothic, German and 
                    Soviet architecture to name a few. See if you can distinguish any of the different styles while you're there!<br><br>
                    As well as having sights to see, there is also plenty to do in Budapest.<br>
                    Ruin Bars. These were essentially abandoned buildings destroyed by war, which have been remade into incredbily cool 
                    bars. You can visit these on your own or join one of the many pub crawl/walking tours offering to show them off. 
                    These are normally paid, but do take a lot of the organising out fo the way for you.<br>
                    Opera. Hungary and Austria share a lot of history, having been one united territory for quite sometime. Which is why 
                    Hungary has a big opera scene. Even if your not interested, the main opera building itself is worth a visit. Just 
                    note that if you do plan to check out a show, book in advance.<br>
                    Thermal Baths. Budapest has a few of them. We didn't really check them out as we visited in the middle of summer, 
                    however it will probably be worth a visit for you.<br>

                <h4>Food And Drink</h4>
                <p>
                    Budapest has a great modern food scene, very reminiscent of Melbourne. Walking from bar to bar, you may even come 
                    across the odd lane filled with food trucks! When it comes to Hungarian food, meats and soups are the usual fair as 
                    far as traditional food goes. A meal at a traditional restaurant, the likes of which you would find outside of 
                    Budapest, will most likely offer a variety of sausages and cuts of meat.<br>
                    Not all the following may appeal/even be edible by you, but I'm gonna throw it in anyways. Who knows, you may be able 
                    to pass the knowledge on to someone else.<br>
                    Soups. From Czechia to Poland and the Baltics, hearty soups are commonplace. In these areas in particular, goulash 
                    reigns supreme. If you want to visit a really cool soup institution while in Budapest, check out Bors Gastro. It 
                    seems to have survived COVID and I am very happy it did. Practically just a hole in the wall, if you're lucky, after 
                    ordering your soup, the sounds of singing and chanting coming from the staff as they prepare your meal are not an 
                    uncommon occurrence.<br>
                    Lángos. A fried bread dish served with toppings. Quintessential Hungarian street food, you're more likely to find these 
                    at a food truck or at a train station than in a restaurant.<br>
                    Drinks. Due to it's proximity to countries like Austria, Germany and Czechia, Hungary gets a great range of alcohol, 
                    however if we're talking about Hungarian drinks, we're probably talking about wines and spirits.<br>
                    Wine. Hungary has several wine regions, but it is most famous for a particular type of sweet wine.<br>
                    Spirits. The classic Hungarian drink is Palinka. Usually made from tasty fruits like plum, it comes in tens of different 
                    flavours and is essential to the classic Hungarian food and drink experience. Easily found in every ruin bar, but also 
                    is generally more expensive there as well.

                <h4>In The Area</h4>
                <p>
                    The classic local getaway for those in Budapest is to Lake Balaton. If you had a serious surplus of time it could be 
                    worth checking out one of the small towns along it's banks, but I highly doubt you have that kind of time on your 
                    hands.
